# Computational Effort

We ran experiments on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1240 V2 @ 3.40GHz with 8GB of RAM.

## Computational Experiments

Scripts `table{1,2,3,4}.sh` run experiments and generate results for `table{1,2,3,4}.csv`, respectively.
* `table1.sh`: ~25 minutes with 8 cores.
* `table2.sh`: ~166 minutes with 8 cores.
* `table3.sh`: ~39 minutes with 8 cores.
* `table4.sh`: ~68 minutes with 8 cores.
